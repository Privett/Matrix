# Privacy Policy for Matrix Bot

**Last updated: December 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how the **Matrix** Discord bot handles data. I value your privacy and aim to collect as little data as possible.

### 1. Data Collection
Matrix bot does **not** collect or store personal user data (names, emails, passwords, etc.).
The bot only processes:
* **Guild IDs:** To store settings for giveaways and custom commands.
* **Message Content:** Only when triggered by commands (e.g., `/addchannel`).

### 2. Data Usage
The collected data is used exclusively for the bot's functionality. I do **not** sell, trade, or share any data with third parties.

### 3. Data Storage
Settings are stored in a secure database. If you remove the bot from your server, your server's settings may be deleted from our records upon request.

### 4. Third-Party Services
Matrix is hosted securely. We do not use any tracking or analytics services that identify individual users.

### 5. Contact
If you have any questions, join our support server or open a thread in the support channel.
